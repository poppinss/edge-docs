= Tags

Tags are the backbone of Edge templates. They let you define the behaviour of your templates. Edge itself does not add any logic to your templates but exposes any API to be used for creating powerful and expressive tags.

== Available Tags
Below is the list of in-built Edge tags, however you are free to add your own.
